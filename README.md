# Hydejack Starter Kit

A quicker, cleaner way to get started blogging with [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/).

## Quick Start
### Running locally
1. Clone repository (git users), or [download] and unzip.
2. Open terminal, `cd` into root directory (where `_config.yml` is located)
3. Run `bundle install` [^1]
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open <http://localhost:4000/hydejack-starter-kit/>
* Make sure to set `theme` at `_config.yml` as `hydejack theme`, not `remote-theme`

## What's next?
* Open files and read the comments
* Read the [docs](https://hydejack.com/docs/)
* Buy the [PRO version](https://hydejack.com/download/) to get the project and resume layout, newsletter subscription box, custom forms, and more.
* I customized my blog referencing ["Lazy Ren"'s blog.](https://lazyren.github.io/devlog/how-i-customized-hydejack-theme.html) and his github.

[^1]: Requires Bundler. Install with `gem install bundler`.
