# Myblog using Hydejack kit

# Sangmin2ya's develog

A quicker, cleaner way to get started blogging with [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/).

## Quick Start
### Running locally
1. Clone repository (git users), or [download] and unzip.
2. Open terminal, `cd` into root directory (where `_config.yml` is located)
3. Run `bundle install` [^1]
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open <http://localhost:4000>
* Make sure to set `theme` at `_config.yml` as `hydejack theme`, not `remote-theme`

## What's next?
* Open files and read the comments
* There might some limitation since I did't get `Pro version`.
* Read the [docs](https://hydejack.com/docs/) for more information to customize your blog.
* I customized my blog referencing ["Lazy Ren"'s blog.](https://lazyren.github.io/devlog/how-i-customized-hydejack-theme.html) and his github.
* If you want to see details of my posts, go to `_post` folder.

[^1]: Requires Bundler. Install with `gem install bundler`.
